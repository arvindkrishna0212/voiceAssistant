## Code Explanation

Let's break down the key sections of the code:

### User Interface (UI)

The script initializes a simple PyQt5-based GUI to display the assistant's listening status.

### Speech Recognition

The script uses the speech recognizer library to instantiate the recognizer and microphone classes.

### Text to Speech

The code creates an engine using pyttsx3 module and the properties of the engine are set.

### App Control

The script uses the AppOpener library to open and close apps. The input can be 'open app app_name' or 'close app app_name'. The given commands will open or close a given app respectively.

### Keyboard Control
